Descripción completa (4000)
===========================

Écija has been declared Site of Historical and Artistic Interest since 1966. It is a beautiful city with a lordly past which is at present dominated by magnificent towers and Baroque domes. Its eleven towers invite us to walk down the streets and discover one of the most beautiful cities of Andalusia.
 
During the Roman age, Astigi was one of the four capital cities of Baetica. Thanks to its privileged location next to the river Genil, Écija became during the 3rd century AD the main city which exported olive oil to the whole Roman Empire.
 
During the Emirate and the Caliphate of Córdoba, the so-called Medina Estiggia preserved its status as province capital and one of the main cities of Al-Andalus.
 
After the Roman conquest of the city by Ferdinand III the city was joined to the Kingdom of Castile. The distribution of the lands among noble families and military orders was one of the main distinguishing features of the city. Lords and nobles became considerably rich thanks to a growing economy based on agriculture and craftsmanship. This economic prosperity would go hand in hand with the construction of big palaces and religious buildings, all of which can still be enjoyed at present.
